## Assessment Structure

### Part A: MCQ & Theory (`PartA_MCQ_Answers.md`)
- Answer **ALL** questions for **BOTH** PART 1 and PART 2.
- Provide clear reasoning for your choices.

### Part B: Design & Implementation
You are provided with two contract skeletons in `contracts/`:
1. `SkillsMarketplace.sol` (PART 1)
2. `SecureLottery.sol` (PART 2)

**Your Tasks for BOTH contracts:**
1. **Implementation:** Complete the `TODO` sections in both `.sol` files.
2. **Design Documentation:** Fill in `PartB_Design.md` detailing your architectural choices, security measures, and trade-offs.
3. **Test Planning:** Fill in `PartB_Tests.md` with your test scenarios.
4. **Test Implementation:** Create a `test/` directory and implement automated tests for both contracts using Hardhat.
   - Example: `test/SkillsMarketplace.test.js` and `test/SecureLottery.test.js`
   - Run tests with: `npx hardhat test`

## Functional Specifications

### PART 1: Skills Marketplace
- **Worker Management:** Implementation of `registerWorker` with input validation and duplicate prevention.
- **Gig Workflow:** Implementation of `postGig` (accepting payments), `applyForGig`, and `submitWork`.
- **Payment & Security:** Implementation of `approveAndPay` using the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- **Events:** Proper emission of events for all state-changing operations.

### PART 2: Secure Lottery
- **Participation:** Implementation of `enter` with minimum entry requirements and multi-entry support.
- **Winner Selection:** A `selectWinner` function that calculates a "winner" from total entries and distributes the pot (90% to winner, 10% to owner).
- **Randomness Challenge:** Application of a secure randomness mechanism (e.g., using block data or VDF concepts).
- **Safety:** Implementation of an emergency circuit breaker (pause/unpause) and reentrancy protection.

## Tips for Success
- **Security Matters:** We check for Reentrancy, Access Control, and Integer Handling.
- **Gas is Money:** Mention gas optimization strategies in your design document.
- **Commit History:** We look at your commit frequency to understand your workflow.

**All the best!**
